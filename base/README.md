# @masterworks/eslint-config-masterworks/base

You should always include it as the base for the other presets. It is basically the [`eslint:recommended` preset](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/) with some extra few rules enabled.

## Peer dependencies

This preset only relies on `eslint` itself.

```shell
npm install --save-dev eslint
```

```shell
yarn add --dev eslint
```

```shell
pnpm install --save-dev eslint
```
